# repo_info.json

`repo_info.json` file contains information about your module's source code repository and the related verifications.

You don't have to create `repo_info.json` file on your own, but it will be created by Nexus team and sent to you after Nexus team has reviewed and verified that your repository is truly the source code of your module. You then need to include this file in your module before delivering to your users, or your users will not be able to install your module. See [Source code verification process](./source-code-verification-process) for more information.
