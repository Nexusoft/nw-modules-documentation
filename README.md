# Introduction

**Nexus Wallet Modules** (or just **modules** for short) are third party code packages that allows Nexus Wallet users to customize and add more functionalities to their wallets (similarly to _extensions_ or _add-ons_ in other systems). Modules can be written and distributed by anyone who has sufficient programming skills, and can be optionally installed by anyone who uses Nexus Wallet.
