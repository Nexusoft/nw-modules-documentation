# Nexus Modules

Besides the core functionalities that the Nexus Wallet provides, Nexus allows users to customize and add more functionalities to their wallets via custom __Nexus modules__ (or __modules__ for short). Modules can be written and distributed by anyone who has sufficient programming skills, and can be optionally installed by anyone who uses Nexus Wallet. Nexus modules can be thought of pretty similarly to _extensions_ or _plugins_ or _add-ons_ in other systems.

If you're a Nexus Wallet user and looking for a guide to install a Nexus module, see **[How to install a Nexus module](./how-to-install.md)**

If you're a developer and looking for a guide to write your own module, see **[Nexus Module Developer Guide](./developer-guide)**
