# Nexus Modules

`Nexus Modules` are third party code packages that allows Nexus Wallet users to customize and add more functionalities to their wallets (pretty similarly to _extensions_ or _plugins_ or _add-ons_ in other systems). Modules can be written and distributed by anyone who has sufficient programming skills, and can be optionally installed by anyone who uses Nexus Wallet.

If you're a Nexus Wallet user and looking for a guide to install a Nexus module, see **[How to install a Nexus module](./how-to-install.md)**

If you're a developer and looking for a guide to write your own module, see **[Nexus Module Developer Guide](./developer-guide)**
